# Overview

Creepers is a 2D game created with Unity and C#. It's a survival game with power-ups and a ton of enemies! 

You as a player will have two lives and lot of power ups around the map to kill your enemies. There are stronger enemies than others, and your purpose is to achieve the highest score, you have to be very focused because you lose a life everytime an enemies touches your player or if you run out of time.

The purpose of this game is to demonstrate my skills developing a 2D video game, using Unity and C#.
